                  <p class="lead">Hi everyone &#128522;. I am a beginner web developer, already know how to create pretty good web applications, and every day I continue to develop this craft because this is what I am really interested in. My main problem is that I have no experience in developing real commercial projects, as well as experience in teamwork. I strive to get this experience in the near future &#x1F4A5;.</p>

                        <p>During my school period I had experience in athletics. I was involved in athletic walking and running &#x1F3C3;, so I participated in international and all-Ukrainian competitions.</p>

                        <p>During this period of my life, I had to take exams to get into university, which I did well &#x1F600;. At that time I did not know exactly what I wanted to be, so I chose engineering as a more general specialty (as there is programming, mathematics and other technical sciences).</p>

                        <p>This is where I first encountered programming and realized that this is the craft that I want to develop and what I really like. The first programming language was, of course, C++, which was both complicated and interesting. The only projects I did in this language were labs at the university&#x1F605;.</p>

                        <p>This is where I first discovered the C# programming language and the concept of OOP. I fully understood the principles of OOP and made several projects based on this knowledge. After that I decided that I wanted to develop web applications, so I obviously started learning HTML/CSS/JS and for the server side ASP.NET Core. </p>

              <p>Besides developing myself as a web developer, I like to spend most of my free time outdoors and still continue to exercise, running 3 times a week and ride a bike.</p>
              <p>Obviously like the rest of Generation Z I spend my time on the Internet watching tons of memes, and other entertaining content.</p>
              <p>I like playing various computer games, reading and watching science fiction.</p>
              <p>In the evenings I read Jeffrey Richter like a bible&#x1F602;(CLR VIA C#).</p>
